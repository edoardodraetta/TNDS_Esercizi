 passing inputs from command line to a program:
 ./programma <input1> <input2>
 needs to be declared as
 main(int argc, char **argv)
 argc is the number of variables
 the first argument is the program itself
 argv is an array with argc elts that contains strings of chars

 if we want to pass a number by command line, we will need to convert it to integer.
 int N; N = atoi(argv[1]); (atof for float)

 pointers:
 & is address of operator
 * is the deref operator, extracting a value from a pointer
 ** means pointers to pointers
 meaning ** creates an array

  iostream.h is the library containing cout and cin.
 " #include <iostream> "
 we wont need to specify the object type

 cout << "text" << varname << endl;
 endl makes a new line and empties the buffer
 cin >> a;
 takes the value of a from terminal input.

 dynamic (runtime) allocation
 we use "new" and "delete"
 e.g. double *x = new double[N]
 creates a new pointer to an array of N doubles
 delete[] x; (vectors)
 delete x; (single var or first elt of vector
 deallocates memory.
 this is extremely important. otherwise the program could result in a memory leak.

 fstream.h con ifstream and ofstream
 ifstream inputFile("filename")
 ifstream outputFile("filename")
 we can use the following code to check if a file has been opened successfully
/*
 if(!inputFile){
   cout <<"Error ...." <<endl; stampa un messaggio
   return -1; ritorna un valore diverso da quello usuale
 }
 */

 use of ifstream and ofstream is the same as for cout and cin
 inputFile >> a;
 outputfile << "text" << a << endl;

 inputfile.eof(); returns true if the file has reach end.
 close the file with inputFile.close(); (outoutFile.close();)
